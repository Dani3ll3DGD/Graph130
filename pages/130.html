            <h2>Bainbridge Island</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Sail in, Slow down and survey the island city's past and present | <strong> By Eric Lucas</strong></p>
            <p class="lead">Life is relaxed on Bainbridge Island, with lush gardens, fresh local foods, quiet country lanes and Northwest vistas that compel contemplation.Aside from communters rushing to and from the ferry dock, everything is as rich and mellow as the famous sticky buns at Blackbird Bakery</p>
            <p> Although it feels leisurely, the ilsand is not backward: Blackbird has been a leader in artisan baking since it opened in 1999; mora Iced Creamery led the local cream revival in 2006; and Bainbridge Gardens nursery and the Bloedel Reserve park helped pioneer sustainable landscape management.</p>
            <p> A 35-minute Washington State Ferries ride brings visitors to Bainbridge from downtown seattle, and many day-trippers walk or ride their bikes, as there is a full day's worth of enjoyment in Bainbridge village, just up from the ferry landing</p>

            <h3>GETTING THERE IS HALF THE FUN</h3>
            <p> Along the crossing from Seattle's Colman Dock to Bainbridge, one sees eagles, porpoises, sea lions, the occasional whale and sailboats posed cinematically against the Emerald City, sapphire water and cornflower sky.</p>
            <p> Although the North-west has an infinity of memorable views, one of the very best is from a Seattle bound  ferry of downtown at duck, the city alight in westering sunshine and skyscaper lights, the alpenglow-pink dome of Mount Rainier in the distance. This visual climax to a Bainbridge visit surpasses even the Olympic Mountain vistas that greet travelers heading toward Bainbridge to start their trip.</p>
