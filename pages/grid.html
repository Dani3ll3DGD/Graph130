            <h1> Grid Based Layout</h1>
            <p> Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas.<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank"> eleken.co</a> /</p>

                <h2>How often do you return?</h2>
                <p><i>By Shara McCallum</i></p>
                <p>Whenever I eat porridge or drink tea.<br>
                Whenever the refrain poor me Israelites sounds<br>
                and somehow calls up castor oil, gentian violet,<br>
                iodine, mercurochrome—all the remedies for all<br>
                that could possibly ail you my mother knew.<br>
                in colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiters<br>
                Anytime I meet someone whose ha-low<br>
                are the two syllables it takes for me to suss out<br>
                they too are every day returning, who like me<br>
                says fi true and yeah man yet keeps marvelling—<br>
                Yu really from Kingston? Everywhere I go<br>
                where I see a mountain, even lickle hill rising,<br>
                am nearish a river or semblance of sea.<br>
                Predictable, kinda pathetic. I get it. But true.<br>
                Just as when night plays the fool<br>
                and a half-way-sorta-warmish breeze sends<br>
                late-summer’s flowers climbing ladders of air.<br>
                Is so my mind trellises. Is so<br>
                trickery abounds, when our one heart<br>
                is ragged, and the other runs roughshod over it.<br></p>

                <h2>Hey Hivebody,</h2>
                <p><i>By Sophia Dahlin</i></p>
            
                <p>its parts; but just one person I think<b>
                just one person speaking alone<b>
                has less than half a mind this I believe<b>
                and if you want to see a whole body<b>

                my angel look to a group of friends<b>
                with much sex between them, ordering<b>
                drinks swirling from bar to table<b>
                stools to outside with cigarettes<b>

                and if something has died in you<b>
                your humor or your memory of desire<b>
                what it was like to broadly want<b>
                the joy of drinking that is gone<b>
                the trust that you are loved<b>
                or that your love is good<b>

                then to be with your friends in conversation<b>
                is to crowd into a body again<b>
                a full mind and participate in it<b>
                in what you are missing for instance<b>
                desire always very present in a group<b>
                ordering drinks on Saturday after the reading<b>
                everyone’s knees everyone’s jacket<b>
                reach over you for that<b>

                across the deep circle of the table<b>
                the couple makes eyes and knows it’s time<b>
                it’s time there is no watch like a couple<b>
                if you want to see an entire clock face<b>
                please direct your eyes to the couple’s eyes<b>
                telling each other the time<b></p>

                <h2>Losing</h2>
                <p><i>Kim Bokhui | Translated by Jack Saebyok Jung</i></p>
                <p>Being a blackbird, being endlessly sucked into<b>
                black night, being lightless, heatless, riding<b>
                the wind.<b>

                Darkness asked:<b>
                why did you come to our home?<b>

                These palms and paws can’t touch darkness, which<b>
                is a large box. Flying. Flying around enlarges the box. Is it<b>
                the inside or the outside of the box, or myself<b>
                getting larger? When it gets larger, can it hold<b>
                more? Should its name be<b>
                the world? Should I introduce myself as it?<b>

                No, the material of the box is important, I think.<b>
                For instance, paper can’t hold water. Spilled<b>
                from shaking, water will devour all, iron or tree or even wind.<b>

                In that case, say that you<b>
                are a water with very fast flow velocity,<b>
                say that you are a mad road, that you are<b>
                running to hold the wind, and have<b>
                a direction.<b>

                But suddenly come to a stop.<b>
                You are not water. As a box, the amount of wind you will hold,<b>
                you must decide.<b>
                You must say, enough.<b>

                How the wind dries the water is how the wind<b>
                embraces and carries the water, taking it far away just to lose it.<b>
                And after many days, how it becomes<b>
                the slowest wind in the world, how<b>
                it no longer rages.<b>

                Even if no one can feel you anymore, you must<b>
                say that you are a wind, that you are<b>
                a breath, that you are<b>
                recovery. To darkness,<b>
                say. Say that you need darkness.<b>

                If a bird keeps flying into you. If the<b>
                bird keeps saying, I am<b>
                wind, please hold me and take me with you. If it asks<b>
                to give yourself.<br></p>
