                <p><strong>The closure</strong> of the Goodwill donation truck drop-off at the Bainbridge Island Ace Hardware has left islanders with fewer options for giving away clothes, toys and appliances that are no longer in use. Kathy McGowan and her sons Roan and Bo Brumwell, however, have offered up a hyper-local remedy: BI Flashdrive.</p>
                
                <p>The trio understood that not everybody can afford fee-based at-home recycling pick-up programs and that BI residents may not have the time or ability to make recycling deliveries themselves.</p>

                <p class="quote">"We began to notice that the simple act of donating used items was becoming more and more inaccessible at [Flashdrive]," said Roan, a senior at BHS. They hoped the program would also serve as a reminder that what we buy and use—and then no longer want—has the potential to find a new home and stay out of garbage cans.</p>
                
                <p>During its development, BI Flashdrive considered three dimensions of giving: Cost, convenience and care. Launched in Spring 2024, the mom-and-sons team wanted to supplement the robust recycling and donation programs that already exist on Bainbridge Island, such as Sustainable Bainbridge, Waterfront Thrift (located at the Senior Center) and Seattle Children's Bainbridge Bargain Boutique.</p>
                
                <p>BI Flashdrive features a different recycling program every month that is free and (often) local. In November, BI Flashdrive collected washcloths, unused medications and infant pack 'n plays for West Sound Wildlife Shelter. In December, it gathered and donated 200 pairs of shoes in great shape that will be worn by others to run, walk on the beach or walk into the office. And in January, BI Flashdrive collected small electronics, such as tablets, home security devices, cell phones, fitness trackers, Bluetooth speakers and chargers to drop at Amazon's Free Small Electronics Recycling Program.</p>
                
                <p>Once registered on BI Flashdrive's email list or as a fan on its Instagram page, followers receive a "flash" or notification letting them know what is being recycled, details about what is needed and accepted, which free recycling program is being featured and the specific pick-up date and time window. Participants then simply email biflashdrive@gmail.com to add themselves to that session's list.</p>
                
                <p>On pick-up day, BI Flashdrive asks that participants place their items outside their front doors, and the McGowan-Brumwells will swing by and take it from there.</p>
